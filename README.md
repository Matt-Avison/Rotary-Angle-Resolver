# Rotary-Angle-Resolver
This device is designed to determine the angle of a shaft relative to its stator using magnetic coupling of solenoids mounted on the stator and the shaft. Unlike encoder devices, which offer a finite digitized resoution, this device provides a continuous and absolute analog measurement.
